<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>You want to normalize texts for the following 5 languages: Russian, English, Hungarian, Danish, and Bengali. Find the most appropriate way to do it. Your approach should: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Work fast, and</li> 
   <li>Produce good results (not valid words!)</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Mark the languages that you would lemmatize rather than stem.</p> 
  <p>Mind that Russian and Bengali have 6 grammatical cases, English — 3 (just for pronouns), Hungarian — 18, Danish 2.</p>
